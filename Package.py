'''Per requirement F and G, the user should be able to check the status (at the hub, en route, or delivered at time X)
 of all the packages at any given time. For example, the user should be able to 
 provide the time 10:47 and see a printout of every packagesâ€™ status and info (listed in part F). 
 Using this functionality, the evaluator can verify that your delivery solution is valid.
